# cache_simulator

Developed a fully functional set-associative cache simulator in C to analyze cache performance using LRU (Least Recently Used) replacement policy. The simulator processes valgrind memory traces and accurately computes cache hits, misses, and evictions for various configurations of cache size, associativity, and block size. It dynamically allocates memory for cache data structures, supports arbitrary cache parameters, and adheres to high coding standards. Output was validated against a reference simulator to ensure correctness as per the COMP 222 course for which this cache simulator was made. (The files for this evaluative process were omitted.)
